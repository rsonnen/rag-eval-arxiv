name: "Robotics Papers"

corpus_context: >
  200 arXiv papers on robotics from category cs.RO. Topics include
  LLM-based robot control, dexterous manipulation, tactile sensing,
  robot data collection and teleoperation, safety and risk mitigation,
  perception and localization, and policy/imitation learning. Papers
  emphasize practical robot systems with learning-based control.

  graduate_exam:
    name: "Graduate Robotics Exam"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for a graduate robotics course. Questions
      should test understanding of perception-action loops, motion planning,
      manipulation strategies, and learning-based control. Focus on how
      methods address real-world deployment challenges.

  systems_review:
    name: "Robot Systems Paper Review"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to evaluate understanding of a robotics
      systems paper. Questions should test understanding of the sensing
      modalities, control architecture, learning approach, and experimental
      evaluation. Focus on engineering contributions.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test whether a retrieval system read
      this paper. Questions must have specific answers - robot platforms
      used, success rates, task definitions, baseline comparisons.
