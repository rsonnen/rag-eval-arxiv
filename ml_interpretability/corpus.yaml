name: "ML Interpretability Papers"

corpus_context: >
  200 arXiv papers on machine learning interpretability and explainability,
  from categories cs.LG and cs.AI. Search query targeted interpretability,
  explainability, XAI, SHAP, and LIME. Topics include mechanistic analysis
  of neural networks (Transformers, LLMs, CNNs), explanation methods,
  interpretable architectures (sparse autoencoders, Kolmogorov-Arnold
  Networks), faithfulness of explanations, and domain applications in
  medical imaging, finance, and code understanding. Papers dated Nov-Dec 2025.

  graduate_exam:
    name: "Graduate ML Interpretability Exam"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for an exam in a graduate course on
      interpretable machine learning. Questions should test understanding
      of explanation methods, their theoretical foundations, faithfulness
      criteria, and trade-offs between interpretability and performance.
      Focus on methodology and critical evaluation of approaches.

  research_review:
    name: "XAI Research Paper Review"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to evaluate whether a reviewer thoroughly
      understood an XAI paper. Questions should test understanding of the
      specific explanation method proposed, how it compares to baselines
      like SHAP or LIME, evaluation metrics used, and acknowledged
      limitations. Focus on technical contributions.

  practitioner_eval:
    name: "ML Practitioner Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to evaluate an ML practitioner's ability
      to apply interpretability methods. Questions should test understanding
      of when to use different explanation approaches, how to validate
      explanations, and practical deployment considerations.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test whether a retrieval system read
      this paper. Questions must have specific answers - particular model
      architectures, exact metrics, named datasets, specific baselines.
