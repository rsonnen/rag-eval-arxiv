name: "Reinforcement Learning Papers"

corpus_context: >
  200 arXiv papers on reinforcement learning from cs.LG, cs.AI, and
  eess.SY. Topics include policy gradient methods (TD3, actor-critic),
  model-based RL (world models, dynamics identification), multi-agent RL,
  Q-learning and value-based methods, control theory applications, and
  MDP frameworks. Mix of algorithmic contributions and applications to
  robotics and control systems.

  graduate_exam:
    name: "Graduate RL Exam"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for a graduate reinforcement learning
      course. Questions should test understanding of value functions,
      policy optimization, exploration strategies, and sample efficiency.
      Focus on algorithmic contributions and theoretical foundations.

  research_review:
    name: "RL Research Paper Review"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to evaluate thorough understanding of an
      RL paper. Questions should test understanding of the algorithm,
      environment setup, hyperparameter sensitivity, and comparison to
      baselines. Focus on reproducibility-relevant details.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test whether a retrieval system read
      this paper. Questions must have specific answers - environment names,
      reward structures, training steps, performance metrics.
