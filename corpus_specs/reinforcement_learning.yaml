    Papers whose PRIMARY focus is reinforcement learning methods.
    This includes:
    - RL algorithms (policy gradient, Q-learning, actor-critic)
    - Model-based and model-free RL
    - Multi-agent reinforcement learning
    - Offline and batch RL
    - Inverse reinforcement learning
    - Hierarchical RL
    - Safe and constrained RL
    - RL theory and sample complexity

    NOT relevant:
    - Papers that use RL as a minor training component
    - LLM alignment papers using RLHF (focus is on LLMs, not RL)
    - Game-playing papers focused on the game, not RL methodology
    - Control theory papers without learning component
