name: "Computer Vision Papers"

corpus_context: >
  200 arXiv papers on computer vision from category cs.CV. Topics include
  video generation and processing, segmentation (SAM2, surgical scenes),
  vision-language models, 3D reconstruction, medical imaging, table
  recognition, action recognition, and multimodal perception. Papers
  emphasize efficiency improvements, temporal reasoning, and cross-modal
  understanding.

  graduate_exam:
    name: "Graduate Computer Vision Exam"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for a graduate computer vision course.
      Questions should test understanding of visual representations,
      architectural choices, training strategies, and evaluation metrics.
      Focus on how methods advance state-of-the-art on benchmark tasks.

  paper_review:
    name: "Vision Paper Technical Review"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to evaluate thorough understanding of a
      vision paper. Questions should test understanding of the model
      architecture, loss functions, data augmentation, and how results
      compare to prior work on standard benchmarks.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test whether a retrieval system read
      this paper. Questions must have specific answers - model sizes,
      benchmark scores (mIoU, AP, etc.), dataset splits, inference speeds.
