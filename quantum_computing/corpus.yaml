name: "Quantum Computing Papers"

corpus_context: >
  200 arXiv papers on quantum computing, primarily from quant-ph (93%).
  Topics include quantum hardware (superconducting qubits, fluxoniums,
  photonic systems), quantum algorithms (VQE, QAOA, variational methods),
  quantum gates and circuits, quantum error correction, quantum simulation
  for chemistry, and hybrid classical-quantum approaches. Mix of theoretical
  frameworks and practical implementations.

  graduate_exam:
    name: "Graduate Quantum Computing Exam"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for a graduate course on quantum computing.
      Questions should test understanding of quantum algorithms, circuit
      design, error correction schemes, and hardware constraints. Focus
      on how theoretical concepts translate to practical implementations.

  research_review:
    name: "Quantum Computing Paper Review"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to evaluate thorough understanding of a
      quantum computing paper. Questions should test understanding of the
      quantum circuit or algorithm proposed, noise models considered,
      comparison to classical alternatives, and experimental validation.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test whether a retrieval system read
      this paper. Questions must have specific answers - qubit counts,
      gate fidelities, circuit depths, specific Hamiltonians studied.
