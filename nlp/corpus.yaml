name: "NLP Papers"

corpus_context: >
  200 arXiv papers on natural language processing from category cs.CL.
  Search query targeted language models, NLP, text processing, parsing,
  and semantics. Papers dated December 2025 represent frontier research
  on LLMs and generative models. Topics include masked diffusion models,
  decoding strategies, reasoning and planning, and model evaluation on
  benchmarks like GSM8K, MATH500, and HumanEval. Strong emphasis on
  non-autoregressive generation and uncertainty quantification.

  graduate_exam:
    name: "Graduate NLP Qualifying Exam"
    description: >
      You are creating questions for a PhD qualifying exam in NLP.
      Questions should test understanding of language model architectures,
      training objectives, decoding methods, and evaluation practices.
      Focus on theoretical foundations and methodological contributions.

  paper_review:
    name: "NLP Paper Technical Review"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to evaluate thorough understanding of
      an NLP paper. Questions should test understanding of the model
      architecture, training procedure, evaluation setup, and how results
      compare to prior work. Focus on technical depth.

  journal_club:
    name: "NLP Journal Club Discussion"
    description: >
      You are creating discussion questions for a graduate journal club.
      Questions should prompt critical analysis of claims, experimental
      design, and implications for the field. Suitable for students who
      read the paper but may not be specialists.

  rag_eval:
    name: "RAG System Evaluation"
    description: >
      You are creating questions to test whether a retrieval system read
      this paper. Questions must have specific answers - model sizes,
      benchmark scores, ablation results, hyperparameter choices.
